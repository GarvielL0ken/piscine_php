<- Matrix ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Matrix class is used to create various transformation matrices.
An instance is created by:
    passing the constructor method a single array. What is required in this
    array is different based on the one value that the array is always
    required: the value in the 'preset' key.
    The preset values are stored as class constants in the Matrix class itself.
    e.g. $obj = new Matrix(array('preset' => MATRIX::IDENTITY));
    
    The preset constants and their required keys are as follows:
        IDENTITY: none;
        SCALE: 'scale', an integer/float that is used to scale the matrix;
        RX, RY, RZ: 'angle, an angle in radians;
        TRANSLATION: 'vtc, a vector that decribes how the tranlation matrix
                           should translate vertices;
        PROJECTION: 'fov', the field of veiw in degrees;
                    'ratio', the aspect ratio;
                    'near', the distance to the near clipping plane;
                    'far', the distance to the far clipping plane;

    The matrix class contains an array arrays that represents the transformation
    matrix.

    The matrix class provides two puclic methods mult and tranform vertex.

    Mult takes a sinle matrix as argument and returnn a new matrix based
    on the matrix multiplication of both matrices. It's not that simple to
    explain how it works so if you want to know use the Googles.

    Tranform vertex takes a vertex and tranforms using the matrix of the
    matrix instance.
